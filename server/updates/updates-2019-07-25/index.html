            <h2>Discussion Points and Questions</h2>
            <h3>General Thoughts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    While performance is a concern, I'm not convinced it's the issue at this point.  
                    The 2x1 grid is trivial if only using the colored square constraints, but adding only 3 
                    additional constraints (2 must cross and 1 broken junction) makes it slow because of the number of variations.
                    2x2 does run with the same constraints, but it takes a long time, and we're only looking at up to 3
                    of those constraints.  See the output below, notice the number of puzzles:

            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Matrice representations of constraints?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Efficiency of code: regenerating constraints each time based on each set.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Somewhat of a bug: the wraparound groupings because a full broken junction removes full lines</li>
                <li>
                    Some rules to drop puzzles from being created: like two coloured squares separated by a broken junction.
                </li><li>
                    Visualizations/Charts
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Notes/Discussion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>From last time: I'm not sure how the results will be investigated, and am holding off creating a specific library on creating,
                    managing and visualizing sets of puzzles. It currently works as you can see, but after some iterations 
                    I'll want to turn the puzzle set management into a library.
