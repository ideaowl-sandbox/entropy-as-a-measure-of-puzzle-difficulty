                <li>Discussion around looking at adding/removing constraints as a form of information gain / entropy</li>
                <li>Goal for next time we met was to create puzzles that included variations of multiple constraints in a 3x3 grid 
                    and see how the constraints affected the rate of solvability for the class of puzzles with the given constraints.

            <h2>Discussion Points and Questions</h2>
            <h3>General Thoughts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm worried about performance because of the number of possible combinations.  
                    I haven't started combining in "must cross" and "broken junction" constraints, 
                    but based on varying just the cliqueCircles constraint, a 3x3 grid takes a long time
                    to run (1/2 hour?).  This doesn't include varying start or end points, and these all add up to making
                    the number of puzzles multiple magnitudes higher.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The code could certainly be optimized better: right now it's single-threaded and I could dig into 
                        the solving algorithms to find further improvements.  I'm leaving these for a bit later but 
                        they might be necessary earlier on.  Additionally, it's running on the browser and could be much 
                        faster on Node.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No results are saved/cached into a file or a database.  If that's done then 
                        processing would just be a one-time cost, and the project will mainly be about measuring the outcomes, which should be easy and quick.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>I did get the 3x3 grid to run once (larger grids took too long and ran out of memory, 
                    though I'm not worried about the memory issue since puzzles could be saved to a database or 
                    local flat file), 
                    and was surprised by a few things:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Note: When I say puzzles are challenging, I mean that as personally trying  
                        puzzles with a unique solution given a set of constraints, not based
                            on the rate of solvable puzzles for that set of constraints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Several of the puzzles were much more challenging than I would've 
                        thought a 3x3 puzzle could be.  The addition of the 3rd colour made 
                        some of them really challenging.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        The challenge of the puzzles seemed to be based on a hump on the number of cliqueCircles: 
                        at first with few constraints puzzles were quite easy, then it got harder with additional constraints.  At some point, though, 
                        the more cliqueCircles were added, the simpler the puzzles were to solve.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Given the number of combinations for possible puzzles given a variety of constraints 
                    I wonder if we can't do some Monte Carlo approach if they do get out of hand (I'm thinking combinations for 10x10 or larger puzzles).
                    At that point brute-force solving the puzzle might be a challenging too, but we could 
                    create some puzzles and for those that don't have unique solutions, test-run additional constraints on top of it to see 
                    if we can't get challenging puzzles with only a few solutions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any thoughts about the issues with complexity?  I realize symmetry is something to look into, 
                    and made some improvements already there regarding similar puzzles with different colour combinations. That said I think 
                    that potentially saves 1/2 the processing time, whereas adding a single constraint creates far greater complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Several of the 3x3 puzzles surprised me by how challenging they could be.  Also, while I do 
                    think that this can be partly done by measuring the effect constraints have on
                     reducing the number of possible solutions, 
                    I wonder if we can determine complexity for a single puzzle.  Would be curious about your thoughts, 
                    these came to mind for me:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adding individual constraints (like a single cliqueCircle, mustCross or brokenJunction) can 
                        make a puzzle easier or harder.  Similarly, removing constraints can do the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There might be some measures we can use as a proxy for ease: number of directly connected 
                        circles, number of seperated groups of cliqueCircles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It does seem like solutions with fewer constraints resulting in unique solutions are far easier 
                        than ones with more, but I wonder if that holds true after adding in orthogonal constraints.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I still have to add in the combinations of other constraints, like the "must cross" and "broken junction" ones.</li>
                <li>
                    Also, I'll need to visualize the result into a line chart or something else.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Notes/Discussion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm not sure how the results will be investigated, and am holding off creating a specific library on creating,
                    managing and visualizing sets of puzzles. It currently works as you can see, but after some iterations 
                    I'll want to turn the puzzle set management into a library.
                </li>
            </ul>
